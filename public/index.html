                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I have always found myself at the confluence of creativity and technology. From capturing musical expression in digital forms, to communicating technical solutions to non-technical people, I am happiest when I'm using both sides of my brain. The challenge of combining the logical reasoning of a program with designing an attractive, intuitive interface is what makes web development really exciting for me.</p>

                <p>Since my parents walked in the living room to find me as a boy with a screwdriver - and our top-loader VCR in twenty pieces on the floor - I have always wanted to know how things work. I have a tendency to tinker and prod until I fully understand. This has served me well when it comes to troubleshooting, debugging, and building new things. Thankfully my parents didn’t scold, but fostered an insatiable curiosity and a love of learning. And I *sort of* got the VCR back together.</p>

                <p>I have been exploring web technologies for over a decade, and really began studying programming in earnest in early 2015. I am actively seeking opportunities and projects where I can write code full time, and continue to grow and develop my programming skills. Thank you for landing on my page and checking out what I’ve built.</p>
